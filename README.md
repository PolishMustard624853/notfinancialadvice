<!-- Pitch -->
“Hey you, looking to make some extra coin?” 
Investing in cryptocurrency can be profitable but can also be very risky! 83.6% of people invest without the aid of any additional tools. That’s throwing money away! That’s why we decided to design a dashboard specifically for cryptocurrency. Our design gathers data on the top coins, making it easier for you to make educated decisions on what/when to buy/sell. 


<!-- About -->
For this project, we took on the challenge to create a cryptocurrency dashboard. This dashboard is fully responsive including a live ticker feed, currency converter, top coins by market cap, graphs, and even a search box to inquire about a specific coin.
